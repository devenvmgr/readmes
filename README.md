## Markdown Readmes

A collection of open source READMEs in [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Pull requests with new readmes are always welcome!

### Why Markdown?

Because it's pretty! But most importantly, it's easier to read; after all, readmes are read by humans, not computers.
